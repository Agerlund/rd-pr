  ## Bio
  Hi I am .Henrik.
  
  I am a .NET aficionado, an ambitious and pragmatic software architect, a
  Microsoft Regional Director, a rock solid coder, a strategy game enthusiast
  and a history geek.
  
  I have experience from a wide range of software development projects where I
  have worked as a developer, software architect, project manager, trainer,
  mentor and advisory consultant. Most of my professional career has centered
  around Microsoft's development platform and since the year 2000 I have
  specialized in Microsoft’s .NET platform where I among other things work with
  teaching, software architecture, web services, XAML based clients, component
  based frameworks, reuse and best practices for software development.
  
  Over the years I have - together with other passionate people -spent a lot of
  time and energy engaging and building the Danish Microsoft development
  community and in line with that I am Microsoft Regional Director for Denmark –
  Microsoft’s selected partner in connection with their strategies towards
  Danish developers. Grab hold of me if you got ideas for stuff we should do for
  the community...
  
  I am always open to partnerships concerning development of products and
  services so if you got an idea for something awesome we should create together
  don't hesitate to ping me.
  
  Talk to me about: Software Development, Software architectures, Design
  Patterns, Software Reuse, API Driven Test Automation (Unit Tests, Integration
  Tests etc), SaaS (Software as a Service), Multi-tenancy, Web Services, REST
  Services, ASP.NET Web API, WCF, WPF, EF (Entity Framework), .NET, C#, VB.NET.

  ## Spotlight
  A couple of decades ago many IT systems replaced manual procedures, but today
  most new enterprise IT systems seem to replace existing systems.
  
  One of my customers has an extensive system targeted at the health care
  sector. Over the last couple of years I have helped them transform their
  desktop oriented solution into a service based hostable one. Their system is
  complex because of not only the comprehensive business knowledge it
  incorporates, but also because of the many external systems and hardware
  devices it integrates with. Doing a big bang port of the system is not
  realistic so our approach has been to gradually transform the system into an
  increasingly service based one. An example of one of the big challenges has
  been how to handle the integration of local hardware devices in a hosted
  solution, but by creating an event based communication architecture leveraging
  SignalR we have solved it in an easy-to-use and robust manner.
  
  Most developers seem to prefer green-field projects, and the aspect of
  creating marvelous architectures from scratch is most certainly tantalizing,
  but modernizing an existing system can also provide technical and
  architectural challenges and the satisfaction of a job well done.
