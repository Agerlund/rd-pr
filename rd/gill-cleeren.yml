  ## Spotlight
  In 2013 Microsoft Belgium decided to stop organizing their yearly – and very successful – TechDays conference. This conference attracted about 2000 developers and IT Pros.&nbsp;Microsoft technologists in Belgium were left with few alternatives to learn and collaborate, with no conferences that could muscle the demand for knowledge sharing.&nbsp;

  With my position as a Regional Director in Belgium, the local Microsoft team asked me engage the local community to see they could take over the conference. I had been running a smaller community-driven conference for many years, but felt that I could do more on a larger scale. Together with 2 MVPs, we started Techorama, a developer conference with an international audience. The conference was an instant success, with a notable speaker line-up in the very first year, which included several RDs.&nbsp;

  In 2016 the conference reached 1000 developers. For 2017, the Techorama team is widening its scope to cover the entire spectrum of the Microsoft landscape, including developer, IT Pro &amp; SharePoint content. With 100 speakers and 150 sessions, Techorama 2017 is now reaching a capacity of 1500 Microsoft enthusiasts. Techorama offers the national and international audience a conference where they can learn what’s new and hot in the Microsoft space, connect with peers and meet a group of fantastic speakers from all over the world.
