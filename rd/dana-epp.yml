  ## Bio
  Hey there, Iâ€™m Dana. As part of my day job I'm responsible for driving my
  company's technology strategy with a focus on accelerating innovation, product
  development and R&D across our portfolio of products. That's no small feat
  when we deliver IT Service Management software to tens of millions of users
  both on-premise and in the cloud.
  
  I've spent the last 25 years focusing on software security and has been
  awarded the recognition and designation by Microsoft as an Enterprise Security
  MVP for the past ten years. This last year I was also awarded for my Azure
  experience in Cloud and Datacenter Management, and was appointed as a
  Microsoft Regional Director.
  
  I travel regularly between my homes in Vancouver, British Columbia and Las
  Vegas, Nevada. When I'm not working or touring around the world to speak about
  information security and threat modeling, you can find me having fun with my
  Internet film studio that produces web based TV shows like
