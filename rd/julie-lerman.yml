  ## Bio
  <p>I've been building software solutions for businesses for nearly 30 years and now focus on helping development teams plan and architect their software. I'm a <a href="http://rd.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Regional Director</a> (one of about 150 around the world) with strong ties to a number of teams at Microsoft. I've also been recognized as a Microsoft MVP since 2003 for my technical expertise and my community involvement.</p><p>In addition to mentoring software teams, I present at software conferences around the world on Microsoft technologies with a focus on Entity Framework and Azure data stores and am excited to be leveraging Microsoft's new direction with cross-platform and open source technologies. My speaking engagements and mentorship also lean heavily on practices from Domain-Driven Design.</p><p>I am the author of the highly acclaimed “Programming Entity Framework” books, the MSDN Magazine Data Points column and many popular videos on <a href="http://pluralsight.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pluralsight.com</a>.</p><p>While participating in a truly global community, my heart belongs to the tech community in Vermont. I founded the <a href="http://meetup.com/vtcode" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vermont.NET</a> user group in 2002 and we continue to have monthly meetings all these years later. The .NET community fostered a variety of other tech communities and many of them share our meetup which is over 1500 strong. I initiated the <a href="http://www.vtcodecamp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vermont Code Camp</a> in 2009 and continue to be a lead co-organizer annually. Our code camp is now an annual event drawing nearly 200 attendees and speakers across a wide variety of technology stacks and entices quite a few people from other parts of the country to participate as well. I was a founding board member of the Vermont Software Developer Alliance and served on the board for its first 3 critical years. VTSDA has morphed to the <a href="http://www.vtta.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vermont Technical Alliance</a> and is an important player in the Vermont technical business community. I am also an Executive Fellow of <a href="http://www.btvignite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BTVIgnite</a>, a partner of <a href="https://www.us-ignite.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">USIgnite</a>whose mission is to spark next-gen applications in gigabit enabled communities across the United States.</p><p>Feel free to contact me about working with your team on site, remotely or even in Vermont where I live, if you'd like an excuse to visit my beautiful state.</p><p>Talk to me about: Software Architecture, Software Development Domain-Driven Design, Data Access, Entity Framework, .NET, Cross-Platform .NET, SQL Server, Azure SQL, Azure DocumentDB, Web APIs, NodeJs, Aurelia, Women in IT</p>

  ## Spotlight
  <p>As Microsoft has been embracing cross-platform technologies, I noticed many .NET developers were concerned about Microsoft losing focus on them. As a long-time Windows platform developer, myself, I decided to “take the plunge” on their behalf. So, I purchased my first Apple computer, learned how to use it and started writing .NET applications using Visual Studio Code – right on OS X. I loved the reactions of my techie friends who saw me whipping out a MacBook, typing some bash commands and deploying to Docker on Azure!</p><p>The novelty of being able to debug and run .NET and C# apps in OS X was fun, but also enlightening. I now frequently use both OS X and Windows in Pluralsight and Channel 9 videos, podcast interviews, conferences and articles to teach .NET developers two important things: first, that Microsoft isn’t abandoning Windows or asking us to do so. Instead, other developers can now share in the coding experiences that we are so proud of: .NET, C# and powerful IDEs. And second, that .NET Framework and Visual Studio continue to evolve.</p><p>I’ve been fortunate to leverage my reputation to assure Windows developers that .NET and Windows programming remain a smart investment and career path.</p>
