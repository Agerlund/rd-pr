  ## Bio
  Hi there... please call me Doc - short and simple.
  
  By qualification, I am a gynecologist. However, while studying medicine
  (1986), I learnt programming as a hobby. Which machine? Sinclair Spectrum
  (32kb). Later I developed lot of medical software and started a company which
  became the best Microsoft Partner in India. After being a hard-core developer
  and infra guy for a decade, I realized that every technology is grossly
  underutilized - and nobody is focusing on this issue.
  
  So I decided to focus on it. And I chose the product which is most used as
  well as most underutilized - Microsoft Office. Since 2004, I have dedicated
  all my time to improving end-user efficiency by utilizing Office effectively.
  
  Primarily I have only ONE customer - Microsoft itself. I work mainly in APAC
  region. Microsoft subsidiaries invite me regularly to various countries to
  demonstrate the value of Office 365 platform and drive consumption.
  
  Over the years, I have delivered more than 2500 sessions and coached over
  263,000 users globally.
  
  I cover all kinds of audiences and topics. From internal readiness to CXO
  engagements. I am also effective across segments: EPG, CA, PSG, SMB, ACAD.
  
  My sessions are highly popular and sought after. Customers call my session a
  "Magic show". The good part is, I am showing them how to be magicians
  themselves.
  
  I write a blog every day - that is why it is called Efficiency 365. I also
  write books and create training courses.
  
  My ambition is to save 15 minutes per day for every user of Office in the
  world. Long way to go. But the journey is exciting, interesting and rewarding.
  
  Cheers.
