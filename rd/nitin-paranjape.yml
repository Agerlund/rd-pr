  ## Bio
  <p>Hi there... please call me Doc - short and simple.</p><p>By qualification, I am a gynecologist. However, while studying medicine (1986), I learnt programming as a hobby. Which machine? Sinclair Spectrum (32kb). Later I developed lot of medical software and started a company which became the best Microsoft Partner in India. After being a hard-core developer and infra guy for a decade, I realized that every technology is grossly underutilized - and nobody is focusing on this issue.</p><p>So I decided to focus on it. And I chose the product which is most used as well as most underutilized - Microsoft Office. Since 2004, I have dedicated all my time to improving end-user efficiency by utilizing Office effectively.</p><p>Primarily I have only ONE customer - Microsoft itself. I work mainly in APAC region. Microsoft subsidiaries invite me regularly to various countries to demonstrate the value of Office 365 platform and drive consumption.</p><p>Over the years, I have delivered more than 2500 sessions and coached over 263,000 users globally.</p><p>I cover all kinds of audiences and topics. From internal readiness to CXO engagements. I am also effective across segments: EPG, CA, PSG, SMB, ACAD.</p><p>My sessions are highly popular and sought after. Customers call my session a "Magic show". The good part is, I am showing them how to be magicians themselves.</p><p>I write a blog every day - that is why it is called Efficiency 365. I also write books and create training courses.</p><p>My ambition is to save 15 minutes per day for every user of Office in the world. Long way to go. But the journey is exciting, interesting and rewarding.</p><p>Cheers.</p>
