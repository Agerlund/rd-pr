  ## Bio
  I've been working with Windows and Windows Phone since the early days and I'm often speaking about the platform and technologies at various events. In the middle of 2011 I founded the company Coderox, currently entirely focused on Microsoft platform with various customers and engagements, some leveraging XAML and C#, others using C++ and DirectX. Before Coderox, I worked at Microsoft for almost 13 years, and have also been the head of development at Infozone.

  I've also been nominated and accepted into the Microsoft Regional Director program thanks to my experience in cross platform client development and prior customer and speaking engagements.

  Talk to me about: Universal Windows Platform, C++, C#, XAML, Mixed Reality and Game Development
