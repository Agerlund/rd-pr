  ## Bio
  I am a Microsoft Regional Director, Microsoft MVP, and Corporate Ambassador
  for itnetX from Bern, Switzerland.
  
  I am strongly engaging with technical Microsoft communities, especially those
  with a focus on cloud and datacenter topics. I am speaking at different
  conferences around the world about Microsoft Azure and more.

  ## Spotlight
  Throughout my career I’ve noticed a need for community activities to transport
  the Microsoft mindset and messages to companies and individuals. I’ve learned
  a lot about the challenges and fears companies face on their journey to the
  cloud by working closely with our customers. Building cloud-based solutions is
  a complex task companies struggle with on their own. As someone who believes
  in the strength of the Microsoft community, I was motivated to run a European-
  wide community conference that brings together experts, customers and software
  vendors for a multi-day event called Experts Live Europe.
  
  Since 2013, the conference has grown to 500+ attendees from more than 25
  countries. I contribute its success, in part, to the strong need for more in-
  person conferences in Europe. By attending Experts Live Europe, companies and
  individuals learn first-hand knowledge from top experts in an easily-
  consumable fashion, discuss common pain points, challenges and solutions and
  make valuable, long-term connections for the future. With this knowledge,
  attendees gain an understanding for where the journey is going and are better
  equipped to make the best IT investments in the future.
