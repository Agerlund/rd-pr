  ## Bio
  Hi, I am Ken Azuma. I am the mixture of passionate sales leader, UX architect, technology consultant.

  Started my career as IT division person, then worked at system development company as project manager, then at UI design / development shop as UX architect, then now, working at Infragistics as managing director of both Japan and APAC regions.

  In this ever changing world, cross-experience is the really important knowledge, I believe so. my border less connection through my entire work life is one of my treasure.

  Also I am regular speaker of technical community which is focusing on User Interface / Client side, as face of every system. My best expertise makes me an advisor for selection of client technology for specific situations.
