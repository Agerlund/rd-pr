  ## Bio
  I am a Microsoft Regional Director and Software Developer specializing in
  security from Boston. My interests center around security, technology and
  entrepreneurship. I have founded more than one software company and currently
  am deeply immersed in consulting and products related to enterprise security,
  penetration testing and storage.
  
  I graduated from West Point in 1988 and served as an Infantry officer in the
  First Gulf War where I was awarded the Bronze Star. I endeavor everyday to
  take the seriousness and efficiency from this part of my life into everything
  I touch today while still maintaining a sense of humor and flexibility that
  allows the job to get done in spite of the fog of war we all battle.
  
  I am a seasoned presenter and have presented all over the world at conferences
  and in board rooms in places such as Hong Kong, Melbourne, Munich, Cairo and
  New York. I regularly provide consulting services for some of the largest
  organizations in the world across the public and private sectors.
  
  Talk to me about: Security, Azure, Databases, Web Development, C#, Docker, Pen
  Testing and more Security.
