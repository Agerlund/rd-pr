  ## Bio
  CTO of [Dataflow International Group](http://www.dataflowinternational.com),
  part-time lecturer at the [Université Saint Joseph](http://www.usj.edu.lb)
  School of Engineering, and a [Microsoft Corporate Regional
  Director](https://rd.microsoft.com), I am based in Beirut, Lebanon.
  
  I have been deeply involved in technology for the past 20 years, witnessing
  first hand how innovation has transformed it from an auxiliary complementary
  accessory into an essential constituent of our daily lives.
  
  Kicking off my professional life as a Training Manager at [New Horizons
  CLC](http://www.newhorizons.com.lb), where I was responsible for the
  implementation of professional certification programs, I enjoyed helping
  professionals learn and acquire the necessary skills to maximize their benefit
  from technology and was selected Microsoft Trainer of the Year in 2000.
  
  With my insatiable appetite for learning and acquiring knowledge, I have seen
  my career sail through all corners of the technology world working on
  Infrastructure Solutions, Software Engineering, Information Security, and
  Business Intelligence and Analytics.
  
  Born in a multi-cultural society - and at the heart of a turbulent area of the
  world, I was raised to not only accept diversity but to value it and
  appreciate its potential in bolstering and expanding socio-economic
  development.
  
  As odd as it may seem, this has led me to observe that the same diversity
  fundamentals I encounter in my daily and social life do apply in technology
  and our use of it. This has shaped my consulting services as I focused on
  helping businesses better understand and manage
  [innovation](https://www.improve-innovation.eu/) and how the choreography of
  various elements of technology can help enhance and empower their environment,
  and this across various proprietary or open source solutions from leading
  companies and institutions such as Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM,
  [IMP³rove](https://www.improve-innovation.eu/), Microsoft, Oracle, and SAS,
  among others.
  
  Still my main passion remains in Education. After more than 15 years actively
  consulting Public and Private institutions on digital learning and
