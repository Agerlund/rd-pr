  ## Bio
  I am Professor of Computational Methods at the University of Southampton (UK) and also our Chief Information Officer. Before becoming a Microsoft Regional Director, I have been a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) in categories including Azure, Technical Computing and High Performance Computing and as a Solutions and Infrastructure Architect.

  My research focusses on computational tools, technologies and platforms. I am passionate about how they can enable engineering and science problems to be solved faster, cheaper and better. I have a doctorate in Electronics and Computer Science, first class degrees in Maths and Physics.

  I really enjoy working with collaborators in diverse disciplines. I have worked with industrial and academic partners in fields including engineering, business, archaeology, computer science, medicine, electronics, physics, geography and maths. My teaching and project supervision is on courses related to computing, design, and enterprise in Engineering. I have co-founded two spin-out companies.

  As Chief Information Officer at the University of Southampton, I am responsible for our University IT systems, information and processes with a team of around 300 staff.
