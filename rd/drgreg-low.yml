  ## Bio
  I’m one of the better-known database consultants in the world. In addition to
  deep technical skills, I have experience with business and project management
  and am known for my pragmatic approach to solving issues. My skill levels at
  dealing with complex situations and my intricate knowledge of the industry
  have seen me cut through difficult problems and situations in both large
  tier-1 and small organisations.
  
  I lead a boutique consultancy firm called SQL Down Under.
  
  Microsoft has specifically recognized my capabilities and appointed me to the
  Regional Director program. They describe it as consisting of “150 of the
  world's top technology visionaries chosen specifically for their proven cross-
  platform expertise, community leadership, and commitment to business results”.
  
  Regarding SQL Server, I’m a long-term Data Platform MVP and considered one of
  the foremost consultants in the world on that platform. Microsoft calls on me
  regularly to train and mentor their own premier field engineers, senior
  consultants, internal IT staff, and SQL Server product team members at
  worldwide locations. I’ve provided architectural guidance for some of the
  largest SQL Server implementations in the world and helped them to resolve
  complex issues. I was one of the two people first appointed as SQL Server
  Masters worldwide.
  
  For several years, I served on the global board for the Professional
  Association of SQL Server. I’m particularly proud of having helped it triple
  the size of its community, and more importantly to me, took it from being 90%
  USA based, to being a truly global community with 60% of chapters outside the
  USA.
  
  I’m considered a talented trainer and presenter, known for my ability to
  explain complex concepts with great clarity to people of all skill levels. I
  regularly present at top level tier-1 conferences around the world. My SQL
  Down Under podcast has a regular audience of over 40,000 listeners.
  
  Outside of work, my current main passion apart from my family is learning
  Mandarin Chinese. I'm determined to learn to read, write, speak, and
  understand it clearly. My next goal is to pass HSK4.
  
  Another passion is baseball (I know that’s slightly odd for an Australian). In
  addition to playing and coaching for many years, I was also a credentialed
  umpire. I umpired in the Pan Pacific Games. Finally, my other great passion
  has always been railways. This comes from a childhood interest that started
  with a fascination about my Grandfather's work on the railways.

  ## Spotlight
  I work with a variety of clients from small start-ups to large utility
  companies and military groups to financial services industries. The latter
  deals with such large volumes of transactions, they inevitably struggle with
  large SQL Server databases that are becoming increasingly difficult and
  expensive to manage.
  
  One problem is that most companies don’t have a single copy of their primary
  database. Instead they often have thirty or forty copies scattered across
  different environments and archives. I’ve found that many of these databases
  are much larger than they need to be which often uses up valuable storage
  space, slows down system operations, and complicates system management. My
  clients needed to consolidate their silo’d databases and decrease database
  size, all while simplifying the management process.
  
  I helped a large retirement fund company reduce the size of their database
  from over 3TB to just over 500GB, less than 1/6th of the size. The smaller
  database is easier to manage, freeing up valuable time and resources for more
  strategic priorities. And because the entire database now fits in memory, they
  also benefit from an overall faster system.
