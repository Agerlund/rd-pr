  ## Bio
  Hi, my name is Benny Tritsch. I’m a solution architect, market analyst,
  community leader, author and founder of DrTritsch.com and REX Analytics,
  living close to Frankfurt in Germany. My expertise is in IT virtualization,
  user workspace monitoring, Cloud technologies, enterprise mobility, graphics
  remoting and remote end user experience benchmarking. I’m also interested in
  writing, public speaking and scuba diving. I'm a Microsoft Regional Director
  and a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional. You can read my blog with a click

  ## Spotlight
  In my daily work as an independent enterprise architect and technical
  evangelist specializing in Windows desktop transformation, I move back and
  forth between software development and IT infrastructure analysis and design.
  When transforming conventional enterprise workplaces and their Windows
  applications to a world of cloud first and mobile first, customer feedback
  clearly indicates that perceived end-user experience is one of the most
  important success criteria. That’s why I've made it my mission to analyze,
  predict and optimize remote end-user experience defined by UI response time
  delays, immediate availability of user data and compatibility with all
  required media formats.
  
  Together with other community fellows, I have developed my own remote end-user
  experience benchmarking methodology and test framework that allows me to
  collect vendor-independent results in a truly unique way. I’ve presented my
  benchmarking results including full telemetry data sets and screen capture
  comparison videos at international conferences, such as Microsoft TechEd and
  Ignite, community events and customer workshops. The results also made it into
  free community whitepapers and social media videos. It's my belief that
  superior and predictable end-user experience on a wide range of front-end
  devices is the number one success factor for workspaces and applications
  delivered in a Software-as-a-Service model.
