  ## Bio
  I am a software engineer, small business owner and Microsoft Regional Director currently living in Paris, France. My interests range from sport to technology. As my company ([Sensorit](http://www.sensorit.fr)) is editing a digital collaborative solution for large interactive screens ([Yellow](http://www.getyellow.io)), I am deeply involved in entrepreneurship, digital transformation, UX and innovation.

  As a former Microsoft technical evangelist, I've remained an active speaker and it will be a pleasure to meet you at some conferences.

  Talk to me about : Programming, Language design, Desktop apps, UX, Azure
