  ## Bio
  <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Brian. I've been active in the computer industry since the early 90's. In 2015, <a href="http://newsignature.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Signature</a> (a full stack, premier Microsoft Partner) acquired my professional services and managed service companies. I spent a couple of years with this amazing team and am currently focused on my security interests.</p><p>My passion has always been large, complex enterprise systems infrastructure and security has always been a very important part of this. After years of going to events such as Defcon and Blackhat, I co-founded a Toronto security user group called <a href="http://task.to" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TASK</a> in 2006 and then an annual conference called <a href="http://sector.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SecTor</a> in 2007.</p><p>You will regularly find me speaking on a variety of cloud and security topics.</p><p>When I'm not involved in something IT related, you can usually find me burning gasoline in some sort of vehicle or out pretending to be a triathlete.</p>
