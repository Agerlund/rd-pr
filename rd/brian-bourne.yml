  ## Bio
  Hi, Iâ€™m Brian. I've been active in the computer industry since the early 90's.
  In 2015, [New Signature](http://newsignature.com) (a full stack, premier
  Microsoft Partner) acquired my professional services and managed service
  companies. I spent a couple of years with this amazing team and am currently
  focused on my security interests.
  
  My passion has always been large, complex enterprise systems infrastructure
  and security has always been a very important part of this. After years of
  going to events such as Defcon and Blackhat, I co-founded a Toronto security
  user group called [TASK](http://task.to) in 2006 and then an annual conference
  called [SecTor](http://sector.ca) in 2007.
  
  You will regularly find me speaking on a variety of cloud and security topics.
  
  When I'm not involved in something IT related, you can usually find me burning
  gasoline in some sort of vehicle or out pretending to be a triathlete.
