  ## Bio
  Praveen Srivatsa started his career with CITIL (now Oracle Financials) in 1994
  and has worked at ADITI Technologies and Orbit-e Consulting. He started
  Asthrasoft Consulting in 2004 which offers consulting around leveraging the
  latest technologies for a digital transformation solution. Asthrasoft has
  incubated StudiDesk - a social learning platform and is working on an
  analytics and machine learning service.
  
  Praveen is a technology enthusiast and has worked with multiple technologies.
  Starting out with SQL 4.2 and Oracle 7, he has architect-ed solutions around a
  variety of data and analytics platforms. He specializes in Analytics, Machine
  learning and Cognitive interfaces around very large and streaming data sets.
  He presented a customer case study on moving a 100TB application from Oracle
  to SQL with real-time analytics at Microsoft TechED in Atlanta.

  ## Spotlight
  My love affair with computers started with a ZX81 Sinclair when I was 12 and
  then moved into UNIX/DNIX, Windows and the Cloud. I now run Asthrasoft
  Consulting, a consulting company that helps clients bridge their business
  needs with technology solutions like cognitive computing, machine learning,
  IoT integration and PowerBI all around a cloud platform. We recognize that
  technology challenges are unique to each solution based on customer goals. To
  better guide them we are building an e-learning platform, StudiDesk, to create
  custom courses specific to customer needs from the repository of over 400
  hours of original content that spans across technologies.
  
    
  
  We transform businesses using the right technology. For instance, we
  transitioned one customer’s 100TB solution from Oracle to SQL while keeping
  their application on Python on Linux. This significantly lowered the cost of
  their platform. We moved another customer’s SAGE based VB6 solution to the
  Azure cloud with which they are now offering hosted solutions for hospitals in
  the Middle East. We leveraged StudiDesk to offer SQL with Python and SAGE
  workloads on Azure IaaS trainings for their teams which was specifically
  designed for them. In both cases, they could retain most of their existing
  skill sets and transform the solutions dramatically to meet their business
  goals.
