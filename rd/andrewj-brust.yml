  ## Spotlight
  <p>I noticed that the Microsoft stacks for traditional database technology, BI, and Big Data were steadily growing, but separately. I also saw them becoming increasingly relevant to each other, a trend reflected in the market overall.&nbsp;New features in SQL Server directly relate to capabilities in Azure HDInsight; facets of Power BI are relevant to both products, and Azure Machine Learning is germane as well.</p><p>With the integration of the R programming language throughout Microsoft Data Platform, I saw how that technology is unifying all four components.&nbsp;Additionally, communities around these products were emerging in a siloed fashion, with the experts on each product a bit isolated from understanding the relevance of the others.</p><p>Connecting the dots, I developed an all-day workshop around these technologies, and others.&nbsp;Called “Big Data, BI and Analytics on The Microsoft Stack,” the workshop was presented at Live 360!, an independent event for the Microsoft developer and IT Pro communities that I co-chair and speak at. The workshop weaves these technologies together, with an eye toward making professionals in the larger Microsoft data community able to leverage them better, and help Microsoft’s customers do the same.</p>
