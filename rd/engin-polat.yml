  ## Bio
  I am a Chief Architect and Microsoft Regional Director currently living in Istanbul, Turkey, specialized in web, cross-platform, cloud and game development.

  As a Chief Architect I consult/work with biggest enterprises in Turkey to help them create amazing software products.

  My technical expertise has been recognized with awards like the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional, Microsoft Regional Director, Nokia Developer Champion, etc. I'm in the MVP program since 2012, RD program since 2015.

  Talk to me about: Software Architecture, Windows Application Development, Cloud (specially Azure) Computing, Game Development, Web and Front-End Application Development, Mobile Development

  ## Spotlight
  I am a Senior Software Architect and Unit Manager for a prominent IT company in Turkey. My team develops tailor-made solutions to help customers grow their businesses. We care deeply about enabling scalability, optimizing availability, and lowering operational costs.

  Technology improves very quickly and we must stay ahead of it in order to stay relevant. My team focuses on cross-platform development with Xamarin and .Net Core, cloud development with Microsoft Azure, and client-side development with Angular2 and React.

  These are game-changing frameworks with the latest feature and speed improvements. They support the latest-and-greatest development paradigms out-of-the-box and offer increased freedom and flexibility by nature. We expect these improvements will increase in the future and we’re making huge investment in these frameworks in our solutions.

  We develop massive mobile applications with large-scale code sharing using Xamarin. In the past we developed the same project across many platforms. This method wasted time, money, and team resources. Xamarin and Xamarin.Forms enable more efficient development cycles by developing a single project on all major platforms instead of individual projects to single platforms. We can develop every application in one project and rotate available resources in other projects when needed. This saves time, money, and keeps the solution up-to-date. Call it a win-win-win.
