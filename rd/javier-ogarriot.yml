  ## Bio
  ¡Hola!

  I am cofounder of Zynn.io, a young startup focused on mobile data recollection solutions for businesses. I have strong affinity for elegant code, beautiful user experiences, scalable infrastructures, plus I enjoy iterating over business models.

  Before jumping to the startup world I started coding at 11, later moved to Sweden as a software consultant for Dental Eye AB, came back and joined Microsoft as Technical Advocate, moved to Nokia as Technical Sales Manager, and my final stop was in Microsoft Mobile. Today I enjoy the rapid pace of startups and the challenge of finding solutions to complex business problems with technology.

  I am a huge fan of C# and JavaScript, starting a crush for R. I mostly spend my time on integrating cloud solutions, designing APIs, and mobile B2B apps.

  For this I usually employ a mix of:

   Azure cloud, Bot Framework,

   Xamarin and PhoneGap,

   ASP.NET, PHP, Ruby, AForge, OpenCV,

   Angular.JS, React.JS, Node.JS,

   structured and unstructured data strategies,

   Google cloud, Google Script,

  and so on…

  There are always new frameworks and patterns out there, which I find fun to learn. My code has powered government national elections, medical software, education software, and business software.

  On the other hand, besides bytes and bits, I care for social development. Coming from a region with so many hardships, I believe that improvement can come by collaboration and creating sustainable frameworks. I’ve been Microsoft YouthSpark Advocate, Microsoft Student Partner, TEDx speaker, Startup Weekend organizer, Junior Achievement collaborator, AISEC collaborator, World Bank collaborator and helped a few ONGs.

  Always open for a good talk, feel free to drop a line.
