  ## Spotlight
  <p>My company, DevRain Solutions, and I noticed a growing interest from our customers needing to extend their presence on different devices and platforms , whether they be Windows, iOS, Android, or XBOX One. Previously we used native tools and various ecosystems to build all these applications. Starting as a one-platform development company, we transitioned to Xamarin which allowed us quickly extend the number of platforms, significantly optimize the development process, and decrease the average time to market for our products and solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>We have successfully implemented many solutions for several companies in the communication, healthcare, entertainment, and technology industries - including solutions on Microsoft Azure, Office 365, Azure Cognitive Services, Bot Framework, ASP.NET MVC and Xamarin. For example, I built an intelligent search system for blood donors in Ukraine. With this cloud and chatbot-based solution, the average time of identifying blood donors was decreased from 3-4 days to mere hours.&nbsp;</p><p>I can provide more accurate vision and technical details to my customers, governmental institutions, and community thanks to the two-directional communication with Microsoft visionaries and access to resources and tutorials provided by the Regional Director Program.</p>
