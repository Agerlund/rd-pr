  ## Bio
  I am a highly motivated professional, passionate about getting more productive
  every day and about letting people improve their efficiency. Seriously, that's
  something, that I can't stop thinking about.
  
  I am currently holding the position of CTO / R&D Director at Billennium, one
  of the fastest growing tech companies in CEE, according to Deloitte Fast 50
  Ranking. My expertise and community dedication has resulted in recognizing me
  since 2011 as the only Polish Microsoft MVP on Visual Studio and Development
  Technologies and Microsoft Regional Director since 2016.
  
  As a Team Lead I am currently developing and deploying business software
  mainly based on Paperless platform. What I care about the most is constantly
  looking for embracing disruptive, innovative technology.
  
  Several years ago our company established a partnership with Microsoft,
  managing and implementing many successful projects, including cloud
  transformations.
  
  I repeatedly appear as a speaker on the regional and international conferences
  focused on the latest technologies, including Microsoft Technology Summit,
  Days of Computer Science editions, as well as at the meetings of professional
  user groups and business oriented conferences. I also act as a leader of
  Warsaw Official .Net User Group, the offline community for Microsoft related
  technology enthusiasts.
  
  I have participated in the Ask The Expert on several conferences holding the
  role of the Visual Studio Application Lifecycle Management specialist. I also
  had a pleasure to work with Microsoft on authoring a couple of articles on
  MSDN portal.
  
  Outside of work I mainly spend time with my recently extended family (rookie
  in a father role) including 2 great dogs, that can eat everything they find in
  our appartment. We travel quite a lot, always happy to visit new places.
  Recently our travels are joined with my triathlon events, that I really enjoy
  attending!

  ## Spotlight
  My company and I have been working with Microsoft to deliver fresh, top-notch
  technologies to our customers. In 2016 we jumped at the opportunity to create
  the first country-wide solution in the Polish public sector, especially
  considering we had prior experience migrating one of the products for Insead
  University from AWS to Azure cloud.
  
  The customer's need itself was an ideal scenario to be deployed in the cloud.
  Standard Audit Files (SAF) were uploaded throughout the month, but we noticed
  there were 2 days of significantly heavy traffic. In fact, 99% of files were
  uploaded within this short timeframe.
  
  My team and I spent several intensive weeks designing and implementing a SAF
  solution which fully utilized the Azure stack, including App Service
  Environment, Service Bus – Queue, Storage Account – Blob, WebJobs, Application
  Insights, and Redis Cache. We ran the process based on agile practices and an
  ALM engine provided by Visual Studio Team Services underneath.
  
  I was extremely –pleased with the result. All major Polish companies can now
  submit their data without delay and the platform itself is designed to scale
  to serve next levels of traffic load. We have proved that there are great
  opportunities in which using a cloud approach can have a huge impact and I
  can’t wait for our next opportunity to contribute to our digital world.
