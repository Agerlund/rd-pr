  ## Bio
  I am originally from Toronto, Canada - but have lived in San Diego since 1992
  where I took my first programming job. Since then I have been fortunate to
  experience many opportunities in technology as a programmer, manager,
  executive, consultant, teacher, writer, book author, public speaker and
  entrepreneur. Turns out there are a vast number of opportunities in the
  technology space - and somehow I did not get the memo that you don't have to
  do them all!
  
  I have dabbled in many areas of technology but my deep expertise lies in
  designing and implementing scalable cloud solutions, microservices (docker and
  service fabric), identity and access management, security and compliance, and
  C-Suite mentoring. I put things in the cloud before it was called the cloud
  and now spend time helping customers reach success in all things technology. I
  also have a passion for helping new businesses get off the ground as what I
  call a "Startup Architect".
  
  My company is Solliance - a unique consulting firm that assembles the "dream
  team" of hand-picked deep technical experts balanced with a trusted
  implementation team to help customers solve problems, scale their operations
  and deliver value. We are based in San Diego but our partners are worldwide.
  
  While Solliance keeps me very busy, I still spend quite a bit of time speaking
  internationally, delivering workshops and writing technical content. A big
  part of my involvement in the technical community also includes my role as a
  Microsoft Regional Director since 2003. I have also been awarded Azure MVP and
  Azure Elite status.
  
  To say that I keep busy is a gross understatement, but my husband and son help
  me keep it real, and balanced.
  
  Talk to me about: Cloud Computing, Microservices, Azure, Amazon Web Services,
  Service Fabric, Docker, Security, Compliance

  ## Spotlight
  My company, Solliance, and I noticed a growing interest from our customers
  needing to release new features more quickly with less overhead and risk. Many
  began turning to microservices principles and related platforms to solve this
  problem. As a business we spent time evaluating the ability of microservices
  to positively impact business agility and scale with less potential risk.
  Through interactions with the Azure team we also validated this with respect
  to Azure customer experiences.
  
  Since then, Solliance has launched a microservices practice that proudly
  includes services from several other Regional Directors. Together we’ve
  successfully implemented projects for several companies in the travel, retail,
  medical and technology industries - including solutions on Azure Container
  Service with Apache Mesos/DCOS, Azure Service Fabric, Docker Data Center and
  Amazon EC2 Container Service. Additionally, I’m running global workshops to
  share invaluable platform comparisons and get the community up to speed
  through our microservices experiences.
  
  Early customer feedback combined with my access to Microsoft engineering
  through the Regional Director Program is particularly valuable in our ability
  to swiftly guide customers to success on Azure, and to continue refining
  platform tooling to support evolving customer needs.
