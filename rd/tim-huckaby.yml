  ## Bio
  I am a Microsoft Global RD, a Microsoft MVP and serve on many councils and boards like the Microsoft Application Development Partner Advisory Council. I am focused on Emerging User Experiences, User Interaction Design and the Natural User Interface (NUI).

  I have over 35 years of technology experience including working on a server product team as a development lead on an architecture team at Microsoft. I worked on some famous and not so famous Microsoft Server products in the late nineties.

  I have been awarded many times for the highest rated technical &amp; industry presentations and keynotes for Microsoft and many other vertical &amp; technology conferences like CES and events all around the world. I am consistently rated in the top 10% of all speakers at these events. Having worked for or with Microsoft for over 25 years, I have been on stage with, and done numerous keynote demos for many Microsoft executives including Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.

  Talk to me about: Hololens, Kinect for Windows, Microsoft Cognitive Services, Emerging Experiences, Mixed Reality

  ## Spotlight
  My team amasses terabytes of raw consumer behavior data in Azure SQL for some of the largest CPG companies in the world and the list is growing. Recently, we ran into a large-scale problem that caused significant worry. Our Stored Proc queries to Azure SQL were falling down, running in excess of six hours - after that process, we compiled custom reporting in Excel, which took more time.&nbsp;You can imagine how displeased our customers were when they wanted to see their data in real time.&nbsp;Even more importantly, these customers desperately wanted to see the data visualized so they could make strategic, product-related decisions.&nbsp;

  Cloud architecture is difficult.&nbsp;I have a pretty strong skill set, but Iâ€™m savvy enough in my own technical years to know how to lean on the best for respected opinions.&nbsp;First, I asked software architects at my own company, InterKnowlogy.&nbsp;Then I turned to my fellow RDs Vishwas Lele (from AIS) and Edgar Sanchez (from LogicStudio).&nbsp;

  Ultimately, we landed on an awesome Azure SQL Data Warehouse solution. PowerBI visualizes and reports on the data.&nbsp;We use Azure Data Factory to transform and move the data into the Data Warehouse so that PowerBI can do its magic.&nbsp;The solution was so beautiful, powerful, awesome, fast, and scalable that it made for some very happy customers.
