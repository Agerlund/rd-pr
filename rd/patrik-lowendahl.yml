  ## Bio
  I've been passionate about technology for as long as I can remember. From the
  first hobbling steps writing software on a VIC-20 to enabling digital
  platforms and solutions in global organizations - this passion has followed me
  every step of the way.
  
  My professional career I’ve lead through clients, through technology and
  through business leadership; A path that have given me the good fortune to
  share this passion many times with colleagues, clients and the wider industry
  community across the globe.
  
  This have taken me into the forefront of the Microsoft community, who have
  recognized me as a Regional Director. Further developing my insights into the
  wide Microsoft eco-system of technology, partners and solutions.
  
  As I look into the future I am excited over the promises technology gives to
  transform the business we conduct and the society around us. I am excited
  because with this promise comes the opportunity for me to further explore and
  expand my passion.
