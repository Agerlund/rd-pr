  ## Bio
  I am an MVP, a Microsoft Regional Director, an MCT, and have a string of
  Microsoft MCSE and MCITP certifications. I have written more than 36 books for
  Microsoft Press on IT Operations topics such as Windows Server, Office 365 and
  Azure. I am an author at PluralSight, specializing in Azure and on-premises
  Microsoft infrastructure topics, speak all over the world at technical
  conferences such as TechMentor, Ignite and IT/Dev Connections. I am a "Gooroo
  in residence" at Gooroo.io and a candidate in the Doctor of Information
  Technology program at Charles Sturt University, with my thesis topic being
  cloud security compliance accreditations.

  ## Spotlight
  As an IT Pro RD, I’ve noticed that many organizations “born in the cloud”
  mistakenly believe that because much of the administration of running servers
  and workloads is handled by the cloud provider, they don’t need to “think like
  an IT Pro” about data protection, separating dev from production, and
  security.
  
  This is likely due to how quickly organizations can get meaningful workloads
  running in the cloud. Because new organizations can move so quickly, I’ve
  noticed that these young organizations often bypass some of the fundamentals
  they’d likely consider if they had built the infrastructure to host their
  workloads in a traditional datacentre. It’s important to advise organizations
  that have been born in the cloud to help ensure that the fundamentals are
  right and can be improved upon.
  
  I’ve helped organizations reach a place where instead of deploying straight
  into production, they use a test environment. I reconfigured permissions so
  that certain people in the organization can modify resource settings in the
  cloud, rather than maintaining a shared administrator account. Not only did I
  help back up their data, but advised the recovery process be regularly tested
  to verify that data is backed up correctly. Because even though the cloud is a
  developer’s paradise, it helps to think like an IT Pro.
