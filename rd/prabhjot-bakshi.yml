  Talk to me about: IoT, Azure, Mobile development and Big data

  ## Spotlight
  IoT and Cloud are empowering digital transformation.&nbsp;They are the future of global technological innovation across all industries and we must prepare the future workforce to ride this next wave of innovation. My company, Getwings Technologies Pvt. Ltd., is doing just that by establishing IoT with Cloud labs at engineering colleges and universities across India. These research labs allow students to learn, design, develop and test their own prototypes.

  In order to introduce more people to the ecosystem, we started the Association of IoT with Cloud (AIWC), a non-profit designed to provide the resources and platform to create a center of community activity. The goal is to connect people to emerging technologies like the Internet of Things, Cloud, Big data, Outernet, Bot and Cognitive Services through international, national, regional and chapter events such as conferences, exhibitions, seminars, symposia, workshops, and technical talks. With this initiative, we aim to equip young professionals to contribute to the city civic authority and small &amp; medium-sized industries.

  One story I’m particularly proud of comes from the Faculty of Engineering Technology &amp; Research College, Surat AIWC Chapter. Raskha Shakti University, Ahmedabad and Surat City Municipal Corporation joined forces to implement a smart parking project system in real time. The project will streamline the city’s parking situation, ultimately saving valuable time and easing the common parking headache.&nbsp;
