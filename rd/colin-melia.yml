  ## Bio
  I'm a British author, software architect, CxO, trainer and mentor in Canada,
  leading the charge with a team of experts delivering productive solutions and
  training from the holographic client to the intelligent cloud.
  
  Over 20+ years I've founded companies both sides of the Atlantic and reached
  out to corporate, open source and academic communities through business,
  events and mentorship.
  
  You can hear my authoritative and knowledgeable British accent on numerous

  time to value for your enterprise or customers on Windows 10 (where I'm
  repeatedly recognised by Microsoft as an expert and community contributor), on
  mobile where my team has delivered applications for major business and
  entertainment brands, and in the cloud with business intelligence and
  optimized IoT information processing.
