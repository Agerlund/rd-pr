  ## Spotlight
  <p>The cloud has enabled startups to move faster and change their strategies around capital utilization. The growing number of *-aaS platforms means startups can focus on building their product instead of managing and running infrastructure. If a capability doesn’t provide a unique value proposition for your startup, I recommend buying instead of building. Startups must embrace the elasticity of the cloud to use it in the most cost effective manner possible. Infrastructure can no longer be static – it must continuously change to meet the needs of the current workload.&nbsp;</p><p>A common challenge for startups is finding market fit before they run out of money. I help them leverage the cloud in cost-effective ways that extend their runway while decreasing their time-to-market. With a broad knowledge of multiple cloud platforms, Linux, Windows, microservices, containerization and DevOps I help startups solve their most difficult challenges by building services that ingest 100’s of millions of data points a day and combine them with other datasets This allows customers to query and visualize more than 3 billion rows of data without any data science expertise. In today’s startup industry, typical turnaround on data ingestion and custom segment creation is 1-2 weeks - our customer’s was shortened to less than a day. This provided a huge differentiator that was brought to market in a matter of months.</p>
