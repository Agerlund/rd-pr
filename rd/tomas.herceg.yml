  ## Bio
  Hi, my name is Tomas Herceg and I am the CEO of RIGANTI, small software
  development company located in Prague, Czech Republic.
  
  I am a Microsoft Regional Director and Microsoft Most Valuable Professional.
  
  I am the author of DotVVM, an open source .NET-based web framework which lets
  you build Line-of-Business applications easily and without writing thousands
  lines of Javascript code.
  
  You can find me speaking about .NET and web development, software
  architecture, cloud computing and other topics at technical conferences.
  
  I am co-author of dotNETportal, the biggest Czech website about .NET
  development. I have published many articles there.
  
  I am the co-founder of dotNETcollege, a company which hosts developer
  trainings and organizes various community events.

  ## Spotlight
  My company, RIGANTI, had been developing line of business applications using
  many different technologies and JavaScript frameworks, like Angular or React.
  We weren't satisfied with the amount of knowledge and steep learning curve,
  and we didn't like writing tons of JavaScript code that only transferred data
  from one place to another. Additionally, we had to build an infrastructure to
  connect the client side with our .NET backend.
  
  We saw the need for a framework which would make us more productive, and which
  could enable even less-skilled developers to start quickly. After we built a
  prototype of the framework called DotVVM, we decided to make it open source
  and build a set of products and services around it. DotVVM made us more
  productive, allowed us to concentrate on the business logic of our
  applications, instead of writing tons of boilerplate JavaScript code, and
  changed our business dramatically.
  
  While we still do custom software development for our clients, we also have
  our own product portfolio based on DotVVM. There are many companies that
  already use DotVVM, and the number grows constantly. We help these companies
  to architect their solutions based on DotVVM, and teach them how to use it
  properly.
