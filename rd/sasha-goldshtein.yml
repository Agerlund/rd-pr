  ## Bio
  I'm Sasha, a software engineer, author, consultant, blogger, and trainer. I'm
  based in Israel but spend many weeks abroad speaking at conferences, working
  with customers, and traveling. My expertise is around performance
  optimization, production monitoring and diagnostics, system architecture, and
  mobile development.
  
  I'm the CTO of Sela Group, a consulting, training, and outsourcing company
  working with customers on software development, testing, architecture and
  design, and lifecycle management. We work closely with Microsoft Azure, Amazon
  Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform, across a variety of operating
  systems, software stacks, and deployment tools.
  
  I divide my time between working on multiple open source projects for
  performance tracing of Linux and Windows systems, helping customers with
  impossible production problems, teaching and speaking at conferences, building
  cloud migration plans, and organizing conferences, including Sela Developer
  Practice, Israel's biggest software developer conference. I'm also the author
  of "Pro .NET Performance" (Apress) and three Pluralsight courses.
  
  I am recognized as a Microsoft Regional Director, and I work closely with the
  local Microsoft subsidiary as well as Microsoft product teams advising,
  organizing, and helping shape the future of the Microsoft platform.
