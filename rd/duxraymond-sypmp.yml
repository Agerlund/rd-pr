  ## Spotlight
  <p>In my work, I get the excitement of helping organizations transform their business by maximizing the full breadth of the latest Microsoft Cloud technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>My entry to the ecosystem was over 20 years ago through my work around SharePoint. I am grateful for the opportunity to author the book “SharePoint for Project Management”, speak at industry events, and engage with the community to support the growth of SharePoint as mission-critical business platform – one that’s providing efficient collaboration, delivering business intelligence, managing workflows, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>As we’ve shifted to the cloud, I’ve seen the scope of solutions that can be delivered with Microsoft technology expand significantly. With tools ranging from Power BI to Azure IoT, we’re entering into an era where cloud solutions can not only support the back office operations and front lines of businesses, but meet customer needs as well – whether it’s a custom mobile application or a case management system.</p><p>I believe the Microsoft Cloud can be the catalyst for the digital transformation of every organization thanks to its ability to scale easier and deliver innovation faster with less resources required. I am very excited to continue to help organizations on the journey to digitization.</p>
