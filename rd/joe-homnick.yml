  ## Spotlight
  I have always gravitated to the concept of “Making Data Intelligent” during my
  over 30 years in the IT industry and over 20 as a Regional Director. My
  background as a CPA has helped immensely as my company has concentrated in
  delivering Business Intelligence (BI) integration into Enterprise Apps.
  
  With the release of Cortana Analytics, we have seen huge benefits leveraging
  offerings like Machine Learning and Power BI into the Application Lifecycle.
  We used Azure Machine Learning to create a monthly Churn Analysis so that
  sales people could highlight the customers most likely to leave and helped
  target emails be more predictive in their implementation. Dashboards, made up
  of Key Performance Indicators and other visual BI data, are the central means
  for delivering BI to support decision makers. Power BI has allowed us to
  integrate Intelligent dashboards into nearly every app in the enterprise.
  
  Data Scientist is one of today’s hottest jobs and is rapidly growing in
  response to the exponential amounts of data being captured and analyzed. I am
  happy to be part of the first wave of people certified as a Data Scientist -
  Microsoft Professional Program.
